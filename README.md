# Template Design Pattern in Java

The **Template Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that defines the **skeleton of an algorithm** in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.  
It lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithmâ€™s structure.

## ðŸ“– Concept
- **Abstract Class (Game)** â†’ Defines the template method (`play`) which contains the skeleton of the algorithm.  
- **Concrete Classes (Cricket, Football)** â†’ Implement the abstract steps of the algorithm (`initialize`, `startPlay`, `endPlay`).  
- **Template Method** â†’ Declared as `final` in the abstract class to prevent overriding.

    class Cricket {
        +initialize()
        +startPlay()
        +endPlay()
    }

    class Football {
        +initialize()
        +startPlay()
        +endPlay()
    }
